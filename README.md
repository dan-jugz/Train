github repository https://github.com/dan-jugz/tracker gh-page :https://dan-jugz.github.io/tracker 
This webapp is designed to help a user check which type of triangle it is according to the dimensions he/she has input.
Irrespective of how big the figures are,the program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.However, when the users values don't pass any of the checks,the program will inform you the dimensions used can't form a triangle
